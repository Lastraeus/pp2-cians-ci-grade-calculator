# Code Institute Project 2:

## __Purpose of the Project__
To create a website that allows Code institute students to simulate what Final Grade they might get by either manually inputting potential Project grades, or randomly generating possible grades (In various configurations) to generate resulting Final Grade. Additional Useful information can be provided to the user such as a breakdown of what each project is worth and links to pre-existing “Days until” calculators, to see time left before deadlines in a more practical format.

## __Research__

__Audience Stories__
“It can be difficult to figure out how much each project grade impacts the final grade at the end of the course”
“I’d love to see a clearer breakdown of how my previous projects have impacted my potential final grade.”

## __Features__
1.	A main page featuring a title and into/explanation with the calculator.
  *	Information about the calculator’s purpose including an expandable/retractable copy of the official assessment guide description of how it’s calculated. 
  *	The Final Grade Calculator itself, with two primary display modes depending on screen size
    *	Table Mode for Large Screens with potential grades selectable
    *	Truncated table (media query and JavaScript to adjust table accordingly
2. The Calculator will also be controllable by 4 different selections of randomisation which will be:
  * Totally Random Grade Selection 
  * Random Bounded by only combinations that result in a Final Pass Grade
  * Random Bounded by only combinations that result in a Final merit Grade
  * Random Bounded by only combinations that result in a Final distinction Grade
3. The Page will clearly show what the final simulated result for the selected grading scenario.

4.	Nav menu to each page: 
  * Home/Intro + Grade Calculator Page (Two nav links to move around the page.)
  * About/Useful Links Page

5.	About/Useful Links Page/Contact Form
  * Links to pre-existing Days Until calculator (originally planned to be constructed from scratch on this site, but scope creep was reigned in since this functionality has been done many times before.)
  * Other Useful Links such as to Code Institute Website / Socials etc.
  * Where to contact the site owner (Potential Contact submission Page)
4.	A small footer with copyright and site info on all pages. Looks clean and unintrusive, but clear when read.
